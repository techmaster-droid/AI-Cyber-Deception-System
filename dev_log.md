# Development Log - AI-Driven Cyber Deception System

---

## Day 1 - July 9, 2025

**Planned for Today:**
* Understand project goals.
* Install Miniconda.
* Install VS Code.
* Set up Git and create GitHub repo.
* Clone repo locally.
* Make first commit/push.
* Create dev_log.md.

**Accomplished:**
* Successfully installed Miniconda (verified with `conda --version` and `python --version` in Anaconda Prompt).
* Installed Visual Studio Code with Python extension.
* Installed Git for Windows.
* Configured Git user name and email.
* Created `AI-Cyber-Deception-System` public repository on GitHub with `README.md` and Python `.gitignore`.
* Cloned the repo to `D:\MyCodingProjects\AI-Cyber-Deception-System`.
* Created `day1_test.py` and successfully performed first `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push origin main`. Verified on GitHub.
* Created `dev_log.md` file.

**New Concepts/Tools Learned:**
* **Miniconda:** Lightweight `conda` distribution, basic installation.
* **VS Code:** Basic installation, opening folders.
* **Git:** Installation, global configuration (`user.name`, `user.email`).
* **GitHub:** Account creation, new repository setup (public, `README`, `.gitignore`).
* **Git Commands:** `git clone`, `git status`, `git add .`, `git commit -m`, `git push origin main`.
* **Command Line Navigation (Windows):** `D:` to switch drives, `cd /D D:\path` or `D:` then `cd path` to navigate across drives.

**Challenges/Roadblocks:**
* Initial `git config` error: `'git' is not recognized...` - **Resolved by closing and reopening Anaconda Prompt** after Git installation to refresh PATH.
* `cd D:\path` not changing drive: **Resolved by first typing `D:` to switch drives**, then `cd path` within the D: drive.
* Getting used to the Git authentication prompt via browser during `git push`.

**Questions/Thoughts:**
* Need to review Python basics more thoroughly tomorrow.
* Excited to start with Conda environments and project structure.
* Need to plan for future storage expansion (external drive) as VMs and data will consume significant space.

**Next Steps (for Day 2 - July 10, 2025):**
* Review Python basics (data types, control flow, functions, basic OOP).
* Create and activate a specific Conda environment for the project within the project folder.
* Practice running simple Python scripts in VS Code using the new environment.
